# notion-backup-ocaml

A small OCaml program to automate the backup of your entire Notion workspace. Inspired by `5hay/notionbackup` ([source](https://github.com/5hay/notionbackup)). 

This project satisfies two goals: (1) automate the backup of my Notion workspace, where my digital presence largely lives and (2) play around with my favorite programming language, OCaml.
